# Introduction
One of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was the focus of our capstone project as data analysis track participants in the Women Techsters Bootcamp. This forms the fundamental basis of this project.

This project is centered on the 5th agenda on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)which is gender equality. The concept of gender equality can be traced back to the late 18th century after the age of Enlightenment, which brought about new ideas and beliefs on individual rights and freedoms. All persons, regardless of their gender, should have the same rights and opportunities; this is the core principle of gender equality. Prioritizing the empowerment of women and girls in economic decision-making will set the world back on track to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals, speed up the recovery process, and improve development outcomes for everyone.

# Research Question
  1. Is the SDG goal 5 being achieved? If Yes, How far So far?
  2. Does a Person's gender affect their employment and Educational Status?

# Data Collection and Sourcing
The initial challenge of sourcing datasets to answer the research question was eventually overcome. Three datasets were used for this project and they were sourced from the World Bank and Our World in Data which are reputable sources of global statistics and data. The title of the datasets used are: Women, Business and the Law (WBL) 2008 â€“ 2023, Education and Employment Statistics, Gender Equality; Ratio of Females to the male labor force. The dataset titled "Women, Business and the Law (WBL)" contained data from 1971 - 2023 but for the purpose of this project, only datasets from 2008 - 2023 was utilized.
